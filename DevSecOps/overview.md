# DevSecOps Overview

## 🎯 What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps integrates security practices into the DevOps lifecycle, making security everyone's responsibility and shifting security left in the development process.

## 📚 Core Principles

### Shift-Left Security
- Security from the start
- Early vulnerability detection
- Security in CI/CD
- Automated security testing

### Security as Code
- Infrastructure security
- Policy as code
- Security automation
- Version-controlled security

### Continuous Security
- Ongoing security monitoring
- Regular security scans
- Threat detection
- Incident response

## 🛠️ Key Practices

### Security Scanning
- SAST: Static Application Security Testing
- SCA: Software Composition Analysis
- DAST: Dynamic Application Security Testing
- IaC Scanning: Infrastructure as Code security

### Secrets Management
- Secure storage
- Rotation policies
- Access controls
- Audit logging

### Container Security
- Image scanning
- Runtime protection
- Policy enforcement
- Supply chain security
