# CI/CD Security

## 🎯 Securing CI/CD Pipelines

CI/CD pipelines are critical infrastructure that must be secured to prevent supply chain attacks.

## 🔒 Security Practices

### Pipeline Authentication
- Use service accounts
- Rotate credentials
- Limit permissions
- Audit access

### Secrets Management
- Never hardcode secrets
- Use secret managers
- Rotate regularly
- Limit exposure

### Pipeline Isolation
- Separate environments
- Network segmentation
- Resource limits
- Access controls

## 📝 Security Gates

### Pre-commit
- Git hooks
- Pre-commit scans
- Code quality checks

### Build Stage
- Dependency scanning
- SAST scanning
- Build verification

### Test Stage
- Security testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Compliance checks

### Deploy Stage
- Image scanning
- IaC validation
- Policy enforcement

## ✅ Best Practices

- Least privilege access
- Secure secrets
- Scan dependencies
- Validate infrastructure
- Monitor pipelines
- Regular audits
