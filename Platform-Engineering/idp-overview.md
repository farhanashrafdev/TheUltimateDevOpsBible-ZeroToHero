# Internal Developer Platform (IDP) Overview

## 🎯 What is an IDP?

An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) is a self-service layer that abstracts infrastructure complexity, enabling developers to deploy and operate applications without deep infrastructure knowledge.

## 📚 Core Components

### Platform Capabilities
- **Self-Service Infrastructure**: Provision resources on-demand
- **Application Deployment**: Deploy applications easily
- **Observability**: Built-in monitoring and logging
- **Security**: Built-in security controls
- **Developer Portal**: Single source of truth

## 🎯 Benefits

- **Faster Development**: Reduce time to production
- **Consistency**: Standardized patterns
- **Security**: Built-in security controls
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource efficiency
- **Developer Experience**: Focus on code, not infrastructure

## 🛠️ Platform Tools

- **Backstage**: Service catalog and developer portal
- **Humanitec**: Platform orchestration
- **Custom Platforms**: Built with Kubernetes, Terraform

## ✅ Key Principles

- Self-service first
- Golden paths
- Developer-centric
- Infrastructure abstraction
- Continuous improvement
