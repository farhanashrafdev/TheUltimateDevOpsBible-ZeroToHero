## ❓ Common Questions

### 1. Tell me about a time you failed.
**Goal**: Show humility and learning.
- **S**: "I deployed a bad config change that took down production."
- **T**: "I needed to restore service and prevent recurrence."
- **A**: "I immediately rolled back. Then I led a post-mortem. I realized we lacked validation."
- **R**: "I implemented a config validator in CI. We haven't had that error since."

### 2. Tell me about a conflict with a coworker.
**Goal**: Show conflict resolution and empathy.
- **S**: "A developer wanted to use a new tool that I thought was unstable."
- **T**: "We needed to agree on the tech stack."
- **A**: "I set up a POC (Proof of Concept) to test it objectively. I listened to their reasons."
- **R**: "The POC showed issues. The dev agreed to wait. We maintained a good relationship."

### 3. Describe a time you had to deliver under tight deadlines.
**Goal**: Show prioritization and communication.
- **S**: "We had a launch in 2 weeks, but the infrastructure wasn't ready."
- **T**: "Deliver a stable environment."
- **A**: "I negotiated scope. We cut non-critical features (monitoring dashboards) for launch day. I automated the critical path."
- **R**: "We launched on time. I added the dashboards the next week."

### 4. Tell me about a time you improved a process.
**Goal**: Show initiative and automation mindset.
- **S**: "Deployments took 2 hours and were manual."
- **T**: "Reduce deployment time and risk."
- **A**: "I built a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Terraform."

## 💡 Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Don't say "We did...", say "I did...".
2. **Quantify**: Use numbers ("Reduced cost by 30%", "Saved 10 hours/week").
3. **Be Positive**: Never badmouth previous employers or colleagues.
4. **Ask Questions**: At the end, ask about their culture, on-call rotation, and challenges.
