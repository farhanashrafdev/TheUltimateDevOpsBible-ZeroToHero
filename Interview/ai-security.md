# AI Security Interview Questions

## 🎯 AI Security Fundamentals

**Q: What are AI security threats?**
A: Prompt injection, model poisoning, data leakage, adversarial attacks, privacy violations, model theft.

**Q: Explain prompt injection**
A: Attack where malicious input manipulates LLM behavior, bypassing safety filters or extracting information.

**Q: How do you defend against prompt injection?**
A: Input sanitization, system prompt hardening, output validation, guardrails, monitoring.

## 🔒 Security Practices

**Q: Explain model poisoning**
A: Attack compromising model during training or through malicious updates, inserting backdoors or manipulating behavior.

**Q: How do you secure ML pipelines?**
A: Secure data access, isolate training, sign models, monitor pipelines, implement access controls, audit logging.

**Q: What are guardrails?**
A: Safety mechanisms enforcing security, compliance, and behavior in AI systems through input/output validation.

## 📝 Scenario Questions

**Q: Design secure LLM application**
A: Input validation, prompt injection defense, output filtering, guardrails, monitoring, rate limiting, access controls.

**Q: How do you monitor AI models?**
A: Track predictions, detect drift, monitor performance, detect anomalies, track security events, compliance monitoring.
