# Secure ML Pipelines

## 🎯 Securing Machine Learning Pipelines

End-to-end security for ML development and deployment pipelines.

## 🔒 Security Areas

### Data Security
- Encrypted storage
- Access controls
- Data lineage
- Privacy protection

### Training Security
- Secure compute
- Model isolation
- Access controls
- Audit logging

### Deployment Security
- Model signing
- Secure serving
- Access controls
- Monitoring

## 🛠️ Best Practices

### Version Control
- Track model versions
- Reproducible builds
- Change tracking

### Access Control
- Least privilege
- Role-based access
- Service accounts

### Monitoring
- Pipeline monitoring
- Model monitoring
- Security events

## 📝 Example

### Secure Pipeline
```yaml
stages:
  - data_validation:
      - verify_data_integrity
      - check_data_quality
  - training:
      - secure_compute
      - model_tracking
  - validation:
      - model_testing
      - security_scan
  - deployment:
      - model_signing
      - secure_serving
```

## ✅ Key Practices

- Secure data access
- Isolate training
- Sign models
- Monitor pipelines
- Regular audits
